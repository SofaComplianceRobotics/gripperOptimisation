"""Synthetic N-D landscapes for the optimizer playground.

The search space is the unit hypercube [0, 1]^dim; the objective is a
max-of-Gaussians surface so each "bump" is a clean optimum whose apex height
equals its configured score. Higher score is better (maximization). The heatmap
is only meaningful for dim == 2; everything else works in any dimension.
